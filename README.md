# Link Formatter

An extension/add-on for browsers to format links. When you click on the extension it will display the link of the current tab as an anchor link, html and markdown.  

This is useful to copy and paste links for webpages into blog posts, presentations, emails etc. The main motivation for making this was having to copy the title and url manually so many times.
